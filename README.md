# zelda-like-game

The name says it all! Screen taps to navigate. Holding down the left mouse button (or your finger on a touch screen) will cause your character to continuously approach that point. Select an element from the panel on the right (currently, only the red orb for fire works) and then drag a path on the ground to make the elemental effect appear there. 

You'll encounter monstrous spiders and spikey balls on your adventure. Luckily, the spiders are vulnerable to fire!
